## General info
This challenge was to create different graphs and plots using both Pandas and Matlibplot. The data consisted cities (over 500) near the equator and the humidities,etc. Iperformed this challenge at a weird time within weather because memorial day weekend is around the corner and humidity is all over the place.

## Technologies
* Pandas
* Matplotlib.plot
* Jupyter Notebook
* Gitbash
* Open Weather API
* Gmaps API
* Visual Studio Code

## Information
Open weather project can be found under [WeatherPy.ipynb]

#Latitude vs. Temperature
This graph shows a perfect bell curve for May 28th. As latitude passes "0" the temperature begins to drop.

#Latitude vs. Humidity
This graph shows a scattered graph with no correlation at all.

#Latitude vs. Cloudiness
This graph showed no correlation between cloudiness and latitude.

#Latitude vs. Wind
This graph forecast was scattered  as well ut for the most part showed low wind speeds with the exception of a few outliers.

## Northern Hemisphere
#Northern Hemisphere: Latitude vs. Temperature

This graph presents a negative linear regression line. The higher the latitude, the lower the temperature.

This scatter plot shows a generally positive relationship between Humidity and latitude. The highter the latitude, the more humidity.

The Scatter plot forecasts cloudiness at a 55% regression line. This is most likely due to the Nor'eastern storm.

This scatter plot showed a slightly negative linear regression line. The higher the latitude the slower wind speed.

##Southern Hemisphere

This linear regression was extremely positive. The higher the Lateitude the hotter it will be.

This scatter plot showed a slightly negative linear regression. The more posititve line of latitude the weaker ther the humidity

This scatter plot showed a slightly negative linear regression. The more posititve line of latitude the weaker ther the clouds;however, it called for a cloudy day.
#Southern Hemisphere: Latitude vs. Wind

The linear regression showed a very scattered wind speed; but a negative correlation when it came to wind speed.
